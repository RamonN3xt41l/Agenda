# What is it ❓

This is a Spotlio test project.

The idea is to have little program that works as an agenda

It should be CRUD (create, Read, Update, Delete)


<br>

# Using it 🏃‍♀️


The way of using  the agenda is pretty straight forward.

Just run the ruby class attached to the project. The file is called agenda.rb

in the menu, that will pop-up when you run it, you will be able to choose menu options, they are as follows
1. C- Create new contacts

2. R- Read all contact

3. U- Update any existing contact

4. D- Delete any existing contact

As you see it is pretty straight forward, i wanted to keep it simple and easy.

# Used Technology 💻

The technology that was used in this project is a very common one, in order to develop the code, ruby on rails was the software chosen.

<br>

# Backend 🔙

If we wanted to make it better, we could have used a database, or any similar data source, in order to keep the data stored and saved somewhere

It implies that no data is stored anywhere, and that we cannot have any kind of login in order to access the agenda. Neither can we store 
the contacts in order to see them between different accesses to the agenda 

This last point is causing our contacts to be not saved anywhere, so they dissapear when reloading the agenda, having again and again the
same 3 contacts everytime we restart the agenda
